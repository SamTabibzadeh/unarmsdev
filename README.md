# Wireframes for UN/ARMS public site

## Things To Do

* Finish content architecture
* Find **concepts/pictures/images for each page**
* Update visual design and look and feel with CSS. Use UN/Arms logo. Look at [Atom.io](http://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/why-atom/) page for inspiration
* Find out why **404 page template is not working**
* Decided whether and how to implement **local site search** (look at local JS search plugins for jQuery?)
* Fix tab fragment navigation on `/records/index.hml` - see http://stackoverflow.com/a/12131590
* Make sure blocks of texts are surrounded by `<p>â€¦</p>` tags
* Fix the bug on Records Management page when displaying information
* Fix breadcrumbs styling
