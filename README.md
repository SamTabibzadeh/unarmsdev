# Wireframes for UN/ARMS public site

## Things To Do

* Divide content into pages
* Find **concepts/pictures/images for each page**
* Update visual design and look and feel with CSS. Use UN/Arms logo.
* Find out why **404 page template is not working**
* Decided whether and how to implement **local site search** (look at local JS search plugins for jQuery?)
* Fix tab fragment navigation on `/records/index.hml` - see http://stackoverflow.com/a/12131590
* Make sure blocks of texts are surrounded by `<p>â€¦</p>` tags
